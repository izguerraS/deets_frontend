        <p><h1>Welcome to The Cookbook</h1> A recipe application to store, share, save and create new recipes with all the wonderful time COVID-19 has created. 
        <p>The idea came about simply because we all have been there where we are looking for a recipe online or a family recipe that is on an old, dated yellow paper that is holding on to its last leg. Deets is here to change that by offering the user the ability to digitally save recipes and share them with those closest (or furthest) from you!</p>
        <p>The only thing left to do is to Signup! </p>
          <p>Only thing required is simply:</p>
        <p> 1.) A name </p>
        <p> 2.) An email address </p>
